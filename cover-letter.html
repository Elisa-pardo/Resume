      <p>Dear Hiring Team,</p>
      <p>I am truly grateful for the opportunity to apply for the QA Analyst Intern 
      position. As a Software Engineering student with a deep 
      curiosity for how things work, I am eager to keep learning while contributing 
      to a team that values quality and collaboration.</p>
      <p>Through my studies, I've built a foundation in software development 
      processes and testing concepts, and I've recently begun practicing with tools 
      like JIRA to better understand bug tracking and reporting. While I am still at 
      the beginning of my professional journey, I am passionate about quality 
      assurance and problem-solving, and I am ready to put my dedication and 
      willingness to grow into real-world projects.</p>
      <p>What excites me most about this internship is the chance to gain hands-on 
      experience while learning from a talented team. I believe that even as an 
      intern, I can bring value through hard work, attention to detail, and a fresh 
      perspective, while gaining the guidance I need to become a strong QA 
      professional.</p>
      <p>Thank you so much for considering my application. It would be an honor to 
      join the team and contribute to creating reliable, user-friendly software 
      while continuing to learn every step of the way.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      </section>
